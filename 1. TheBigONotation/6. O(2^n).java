// Exponential growth O(2^n)

// The exponential growth is the opposite of Logarithmi growth
// Logarithmic curve => slow down as the input size grows
// Exponential curve => grows faster and faster
// An algorithm that runs in exponential time is not scalable at all => very slow very soon

// These growth rates we have seen are not the only ones => but we see most all the time

//  CONSTANT    O(1)
//  LOGARITHMIC O(log n)
//  LINEAR      O(n)
//  QUADRATIC   O(n^2)
//  EXPONENTIAL O(2^n)
